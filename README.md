Excerpt from doctoral work, showing how the galaxies ("kids") are affected by the neighborhood they live in.
The main result of the document shows that:
1) yes, the density ("genetics", "parents", nature hypohesis) obviously plays a hole in how "bright" they are
2) after controlling for the nature effect, we still get resudual effects, strongly indicating effects of the environment/anysotropy (Nurture hypotheis.)
