Please, do open the .ipynb file with a jupyter notebook.
For clarity, it is strongly recommended to use the jupyter extensions i) Collapsible headings; ii) Table of Contents (2)

Context:
- Imagine a population sensus and that you work for a city board. 
- Consider that the city wants to understand if there is any relation between how smart/bright kids are and the neighborhoods they live in.
- And if there is a relation, can you evaluate how the existence of services/playgrounds/schools in the neighboorhood affects the "brightness" of these kids.
- An obvious motivation from the city board would be to check if it is worth investing in infrastructure or not, from the kid-brigthness point of view.

Update of the context:
- your kids are galaxies, your neighborhoods definitions are not clear;
- the "services" (nurture hypothesis) are measured with respect to a quantity called anisotropy

Excerpt from doctoral work, showing how the galaxies ("kids") are affected by the neighborhood they live in.
The main result of the document shows that:
1) yes, the density ("genetics", "parents", nature hypohesis) obviously plays a hole in how "bright" they are
2) after controlling for the nature effect, we still get resudual effects, strongly indicating effects of the environment/anysotropy (Nurture hypotheis.)
